# Pixify

A Image Compression Tool Written in Go

## About

Pixify is an efficient image compression tool that integrates three major APIs: Imgur, ImageShack, and TinyPNG. Users can conveniently choose the image they wish to compress by providing the link to the service. Once selected, the image is seamlessly transmitted to TinyPNG for compression, ensuring optimal file size reduction without compromising quality.

## Formats

For now the service supports **JPG** and **PNG** formats.
